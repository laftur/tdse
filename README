TDSE: Top-down shooter engine

For general building and installation instructions, see INSTALL.

For a list of user-visible changes, see NEWS.

For a list of notable changes, see ChangeLog.

As the project develops, documentation will be provided on function and features
as they are added. For now, TDSE is little more than a demonstration. Its
function and features are subject to substantial changes.

To run the demo program, first it must be built (see INSTALL). Before running,
ensure your working directory is that of the demo program (src/demo). Try
running 'cd src/demo && ./demo'. The demo will always search the current working
directory for its graphics shader files (*.glsl).

TDSE is developed and maintained by Jeremy Starnes. For questions and comments
regarding TDSE that are not bug reports or feature requests, you may send emails
to <laftur.jeremy@gmail.com>.
