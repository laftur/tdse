  CONFIGURATION

Run 'autoreconf --install' to install the build system, which will require GNU
autotools. To configure this package for building and installation, simply run
'./configure'. This will check your system for dependencies and other things.
Unless you're cross-compiling or otherwise know what you're doing, proceed to
BUILDING. To configure for building on a particular platform, specify
'--build=platform'. To configure building for a particular platform, specify
'--host=platform'. For example:

  './configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=i586-mingw32msvc'

Will configure the package for use on i586-mingw32msvc, but to be built on
GNU/Linux.

For help with other advanced configuration options, run './configure --help'.
