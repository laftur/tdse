  CONFIGURATION

Run 'autoreconf --install' to install the build system, which will require GNU
autotools. To configure this package for building and installation, simply run
'./configure'. This will check your system for dependencies and other things.
You may also supply configuration options, like so:

  './configure --enable-demo'

This will enable building the demo, with graphics to show what TDSE can do. For
help with other advanced configuration options, run './configure --help'.
